# Suggestion Box

A simple demonstration application allowing users to create suggestions (tech/learning focused) and have the application randomly provide a suggestion.

## Goals

The intent is to create the application using our current technology stack (Java/Spring Boot, JSP, JS/jQuery, Bootstrap 4) and incrementally introduce enhanced frontend (or backend) techniques.  

With this highlevel goal in mind, here are potential versions (nothing set in stone at this point):

- Version 0: Traditional Design using Spring Boot with JSP views having Bootstrap 4 CSS framework with jQuery and our in-house standardized JavaScript modules
- Version 1: Introduce modern JS features (and modules); eliminate jQuery
- Version 2: Bundle JavaScript resources into a single dependency (using webpack with Maven frontend plugin?)
- Version 3: Remove JSP views in favor of API only backend with JavaScript powered (SPA?) frontend
- Version 4: Utlize JavaScript framework like Vue to powered frontend
- Version 5: Migrate backend to BaaS API (JAM stack-like?)
- Version 6: ?
